//Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

//PREP

//P: string larger than two characters
//R: string with first and last character removed
//E: 

// "hello" => return "ell"
//"world" => return "orl"
//"apple" => return "ppl"


//Answer

function removeChar(str){
   return str.slice(1, str.length -1)
  };
  

console.log(removeChar("hello"))
console.log(removeChar("world"))
console.log(removeChar("apple"))
