//The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. 
//They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

//To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7.
//In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

//Input
//Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. 
//Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

//Output
//Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

//P: array with an array of integers
//R: aray of string values. "senior" if over 55 with handicap of 7. else "open"
//E: 

//[[45, 12],[55,21],[19, -2],[104, 20]] => return ["Open", "Senior", "Open", "Senior"]
//[[3, 12],[55,1],[91, -2],[53, 23]] => return ["Open", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

//Answer

function openOrSenior(data){
    let membership = []
    for(let i = 0; i < data.length; i++){
        if(data[i][0] >= 55 && data[i][1] > 7){
            membership.push("Senior")
        } else {
            membership.push("Open")
        }
    } return membership
}


console.log(openOrSenior([[45, 12],[55,21],[19, -2],[104, 20]]))
console.log(openOrSenior([[3, 12],[55,1],[91, -2],[53, 23]]))
