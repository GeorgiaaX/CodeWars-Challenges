//Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

//PREP

//P: number > 0
//R: sum of numbers up to the number passed in as an argument
//E: 

//2 => return 3 (1 + 2)
//8 => return 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

//Answer:

let summation = function (num) {
   //loop
   let sum = 0;
   for(let i = 0; i <= num; i++){
      sum += i
   }
   return sum
 }

 console.log(summation(2))
 console.log(summation(8))
