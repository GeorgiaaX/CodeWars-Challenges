//Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.

//PREP
//P: string
//R: return shortest word in string
//E: 

//Will bitcoin take over the world maybe who knows perhaps => return 3
//turns out random test cases are easier than writing out basic ones => returns 3
//Let's travel abroad shall we => returns 2

//Answer 

function findShort(str){
    return Math.min(...str.split(" ").map(word => word.length))
}

console.log(findShort("Will bitcoin take over the world maybe who knows perhaps"))
console.log(findShort("turns out random test cases are easier than writing out basic ones"))
console.log(findShort("Let's travel abroad shall we"))
